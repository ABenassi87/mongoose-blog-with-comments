# A node/express/mongoose blog app example using modern JS language features

## Features:
 
 - lots of comments in the code so you can (hopefully) figure it out a bit easier
 - async/await to simplify working with promises. 
 [MDN doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)

 - modular, add a `/server/api/<newFeature>` folder and change `server/api/api.js` to enable the newly added router and models
 - TODO demonstrates relations between mongoose collections (e.g. (blog post) -> (post comments) )
 
## Installation/usage

- `git clone` it locally or (better) fork it with Github
- run `npm install` or `yarn` 
- run `npm run develop` in a terminal to start developing locally. The server will reload every time you make changes in the code
- `npm run test:api` will run all the tests it can find in the server folder and its subfolders. You need to name the test files after this pattern: `someArbitraryName.test.js`

### Misc.

*Works on my machine*â„¢ with node version `v8.9.0` 

Not yet tested on Windows, so YMMV.
