# A node/express/mongoose blog app example

## Features:
 
 - lots of comments in the code so you can (hopefully) easier figure it out
 - async/await to simplify working with promises
 - modular, add a `/server/api/<newFeature>` folder and change `server/api/api.js` to enable the newly added router and models
 - TODO demonstrates relations between mongoose collections (e.g. (blog post) -> (post comments) )
 
## Installation

- `git clone` it locally or (better) fork it with Github
- run `npm install` or `yarn` 
- run `npm run develop` to start developing locally
